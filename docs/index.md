## Lab Overview

{: .warning }
> Because GitHub Copilot, and generative AI at large, is probabilistic rather than deterministic, the exact code, files changed, etc., may vary. As a result, you may notice slight differences between screenshots and code snippets in the lab and your experience. This is to be expected, and is just the nature of working with this class of tools.

## Scenario

The lab envisions you as a new developer for Tailspin Toys, a fictional company who provides crowdfunding for boardgames with a DevOps theme - a huge market! You are tasked with creating issues to document the desired updates to the application and DevOps flow, then implementing the ability to filter games by both category and publisher. You'll work iteratively, exploring both the site and Copilot's capabilities, to complete the tasks.

## Get Started

OK, let's [get going by starting with the setup](0-prereqs.html)!
