# Tailspin Toys

This repository contains the project for a 1 hour guided workshop to explore GitHub Copilot Agent Mode and related features in Visual Studio Code. The project is a website for a fictional game crowd-funding company, with a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) backend using [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [Astro](https://astro.build/) frontend using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) for dynamic pages.

To begin the workshop, start at [docs/README.md](./docs/README.md)
